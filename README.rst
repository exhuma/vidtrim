VidTrim
=======


VidTrim is a simple tool to find special frames in a video and extract
start/end positions where these frames are found. This position file can then
be used to extract these sections from the video.


.. warning::

    This is in a VERY messy state right now. Not sure if I will take the time
    to clean it up...
